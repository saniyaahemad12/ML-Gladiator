# ⚔️ ML Gladiator
ML Gladiator is an interactive web-based platform that allows users to upload their own datasets and automatically determines which machine learning algorithm performs best on the given data. It supports supervised, unsupervised, and (coming soon) reinforcement learning techniques, offering a powerful yet beginner-friendly tool for data scientists, students, and enthusiasts.

## 🚀 Features

🧠 Automatic evaluation of multiple ML algorithms

📊 Performance comparison based on metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and others

🔍 Support for:

Supervised Learning: Classification & Regression

Unsupervised Learning: Clustering

Reinforcement Learning (coming soon)

📁 Easy dataset upload interface (.csv format)

🖥️ Clean and responsive UI

🐍 Powered by Python, Flask, and scikit-learn

## ⚙️ How It Works
Upload a CSV dataset via the web interface.

ML Gladiator automatically detects the type of task (classification, regression, clustering).

A set of relevant ML algorithms are trained and tested.

The best-performing algorithm is identified and visualized with key metrics.

## 🧠 Example Use Cases
Quickly benchmark ML models for new datasets

Educational tool for understanding how different models perform

Prototype model selection before deep hyperparameter tuning
